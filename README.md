🎉 Fun Home Screen 🚀

Welcome to Fun Home Screen, the iOS app that lets you revamp your iPhone's look with custom app icons that match your style! Why stick with the same old icons when you can make your home screen pop with creativity?

✨ Features

📱 Screenshot Magic: Upload your iPhone home screen screenshots.
🔍 App Name Detective: Automatically extracts app names from your screenshots.
🎨 Theme-Based Icon Wizardry: Enter a theme and watch as unique icons are conjured up just for you!
💾 Save and Flaunt: Store your new icons directly in your photo library.
🛠️ How It Works

Snap It: Upload up to 5 screenshots of your home screen.
Analyze It: The app extracts app names from the screenshots using OpenAI's cutting-edge GPT-4 model.
Theme It: Choose your desired theme—be it "neon cyberpunk" or "cute pastel animals"—and let the magic happen!
Create It: The app uses OpenAI's DALL-E 3 model to design icons that fit your vibe.
Save It: Download your cool new icons to your photo library and show off your uniquely styled home screen!
🗂️ Project Structure

ContentView.swift: The heart of the app, managing the user interface and navigation.
FunHomeScreenApp.swift: The launch pad of your customization journey.
OpenAIService.swift: The brain that connects with OpenAI, powering both the image generation and app name extraction.
ImagePicker.swift: A custom tool for selecting the best screenshots for icon customization.
APIKeys.swift: Holds your OpenAI API keys. (Pssst... don't forget to add yours!)
⚠️ Important Note

This app leverages OpenAI’s API and adheres to their rate limits (5 requests per minute). So, if you're creating a ton of icons, sit back and relax—it might take a few minutes (around 5-10 minutes per home screen screenshot). Also, each screenshot costs roughly 90 cents for 30 icon generations. Keep in mind, this was a quick side project done for fun, so if you want to improve it, go wild!

🚀 Quick Setup

Clone the repo.
Add your OpenAI API key to APIKeys.swift.
Run the app and start creating!
